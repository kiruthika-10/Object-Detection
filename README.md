🎯 Object Detection Using YOLOv7

📘 • Overview

• The Object Detection project uses the **YOLOv7 (You Only Look Once)** deep learning model to accurately detect and classify objects in real-time.
• YOLOv7 is a cutting-edge object detection architecture known for its balance of **speed and precision**, making it ideal for tasks such as **surveillance, autonomous vehicles, traffic monitoring**, and more.

• The system processes images or video frames, identifies objects, and returns predictions with:
 • Bounding boxes
 • Class labels
 • Confidence scores

• This enables automated and efficient visual understanding across diverse applications.

🔍 • Features

• ✅ Real-time detection on images, video streams, or webcam feeds
• 📦 Precise bounding box predictions around each object
• 🏷️ Classification of detected objects by category (e.g., person, car, dog)
• 📊 Confidence scores to reflect prediction certainty
• 🧠 Powered by YOLOv7 with PyTorch for training and inference
• 🖼️ Integrated with OpenCV for visualization and preprocessing
• 📈 Data handling using Pandas for logging and analysis
• 📉 Optional visualization using Matplotlib for plots and performance metrics

🧭 • Project Workflow

• 1. Set Up the Environment

• Install Python 3.x and required libraries
• Clone the YOLOv7 repository and place model weights in the `weights/` folder

• 2. Prepare the Dataset

• Use a standard dataset like **COCO** or **Pascal VOC**, or a custom dataset
• Annotate images using **LabelImg** or similar tools
• Convert annotations to **YOLO format**

• 3. Preprocess the Data

• Resize and normalize images using **OpenCV** or preprocessing scripts
• Organize dataset into **train/val/test** splits

• 4. Model Training

• Load YOLOv7 and adjust the number of output classes
• Configure training parameters: **batch size, epochs, learning rate**, etc.
• Start training using `train.py`
• Monitor performance using **loss curves** or **Tensorboard**

• 5. Model Testing and Evaluation

• Run evaluation with `test.py` on the validation/test set
• Evaluate **mAP (mean Average Precision)**, **precision**, and **recall**

• 6. Object Detection on New Data

• Run inference on new images, video files, or webcam using `detect.py`
• The script outputs:
 • Bounding boxes
 • Class names
 • Confidence levels
 • Annotated images/videos in an `output/` folder

• 7. Visualization

• Use **OpenCV** to draw bounding boxes and labels
• Use **Matplotlib** to create charts, performance plots, and more

• 8. Optimization (Optional)

• Apply **pruning** or **quantization** to speed up inference
• Convert model to **ONNX** or **TensorRT** for deployment on edge devices
